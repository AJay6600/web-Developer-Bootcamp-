    <h1>Chicken</h1>

    <p>The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the <span class="bold"> red junglefowl</span> , 
        originally from Southeast Asia. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of <span class="bold">junglefowl</span>> 
        (the <span class="bold">grey junglefowl</span>, <span class="bold">Ceylon junglefowl</span>, and <span class="bold">green junglefowl</span> ).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds,
         and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called
          a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a <span class="bold">pullet</span> . Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming 
          both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in 
          some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.
