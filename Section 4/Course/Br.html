    <p>The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl,<br>
        originally from Southeast Asia. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl <br>
        (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds,<br>
         and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is calledbr <br>
          a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming  <br>
          both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in <br>
          some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers. <br>
